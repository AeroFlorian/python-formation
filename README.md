# python-formation

## Poker table implementation
This is a simple repo for trainees to learn how to use python.
I personally feel like testing is a part of implementation, so we will use pytest to test our code.
We can divide this exercise in several steps
Trainees will install pytest in their venv with command
    pip install pytest

## Step 1 - Create Cards - Implementation
This first exercise will show the syntax needed to create a simple class and enums
1. create enums for Color and CardValues
2. create the Card class
    - 2 attributes: color and value (value name is a bit tricky because of enums, maybe rename that)
    - A representation

## Step 2 - Create Cards - Testing
In this exercise we will use pytest for the first time.
It will learn trainees to use import, as well as the whole pytest framework
1. create a first test that just asserts (False then True)
2. create a test to check that Card class exists, that it has 2 attributes color and value
